- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) - MongoDB is a general purpose, document-based, distributed database built for modern application developers and for the cloud era.
- [Passport](http://www.passportjs.org/) - Passport - Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js.
